          <h4>Q.) What is remote support?</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Remote support is a new technology that allows experienced techs to connect to your computer and "control" it as if</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">that tech was sitting in front of your machine. This allows us to provide fast superior tech support to you at a reduced</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">cost due to no travel expenses.</p>
          <h4>Q.) Is Remote Support Safe? Can my tech gain access to my PC at a later time without my permission?</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Yes and No. Yes Remote Support is safe. Our technology is designed with your security at heart. Prior to your tech connecting </p>
	          <p class="faq-font">to your machine, your tech will provide you with a 9-digit Single-Use Support Key, that is only valid for one session. </p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Without you entering this support key on our website we cannot connect to your machine unless you activate Unattended Support™ on your account.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Furthermore, not only is that 9-digit Single-Use Support Key valid for one session, but is only valid for a limited time.</p>
          <h4>Q.) Now @gNosis provides Unattended Support™, what the heck does this mean? Is my PC and data still safe?</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Yes @gNosis now provides a new feature called Unattended Support™ which is now included in all of our unlimited plans.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">What this means is now you as a member have greater flexibility to control your schedule and when you want your computer serviced.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">By activating Unattended Support™ on your computer, this allows your tech to create a secret code which in turn will allow us to</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">connect to your computer at a later time (determined by you) without the need for you to be home.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">So busy moms can be out car pooling and come home to a repaired machine.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Only your assigned agent will know this code, and you can temporarily revoke (disable) or even permanently revoke (disable)</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Unattended Support™ at any time. Furthermore we adhere to a strict customer integrity and data security policy.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Our file transfer feature that allows us to send files back and forth to your computer is deactivated during unattended support sessions.</p>
          <h4>Q.) Is my personal data safe if I use Remote Support services?</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Yes. Obviously our service allows us to transfer data back and forth between our machine and yours, and allows us to install</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">software on your system, but all of this is done in front of you. We will never connect to your system without you being present in front of your machine.</p>
          <h4>Q.) What if I am not satisfied with my tech and no longer want to remain connected?</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Certainly we always want you to be satisfied, but if you are not, you can boot us from your system at anytime</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">with our easy to use software. Also, if you are ever unhappy with our service please report it to us by clicking here.</p>
          <h4>Q.) Will I have to download anything to my PC in order to use your services</h4>
            <p class="faq-font">A.) Yes, upon initial connection to your system you will be required to download our software.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">This is a one time occurrence (per PC). Our software is safe, spy-ware free, and does not use any system resources when not in use.</p>
	          <p class="faq-font">Furthermore it is secure as we previously stated.</p>
